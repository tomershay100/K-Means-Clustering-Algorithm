This output folder contains all the output files for the K-Means algorithm with k = 16 on the dog.jpeg image file.
The flags used in the algorithm are: -c -g -l -i -p -o 


colors_k16.txt contains the only 16 colors that been used in the final image. 
loss_k16.txt contains the final loss value of the best iteration.
final_image_k16.jpeg contains the final image with only 16 colors.loss_graph_k16.png contains the loss function graph of the algorithm.
3D_model_init_k16.png contains the centroids and the pixels position in a 3D space. The centroids are bigger and their color is yellow. 3D_model_after_k16.png contains the centroids position in a 3D space. The centroid's color is their real color.
